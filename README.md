Enter Solana. It’s not a fix for the marketplace issues around NFTs (we’ll get to that later), but it does offer a far more accessible user experience for NFT beginners who want to start collecting and minting. Solana has seen runaway price-action success throughout the start of September, and many observers attribute that to the explosion of NFT-based activity on the platform.
The Degenerate Ape Academy is credited with leading the charge, and was the harbinger for beginning of SOL’s meteoric rise, but other projects have quickly followed suit, with Soltopia’s Solbears and Solcats gaining extraordinary community traction, and gaming projects like Aurory and Kaiju Cards also seeing success. The fact is, due to Solana’s fast transaction speeds and low costs, minting on the blockchain is far more accessible that it ever could be on Ethereum, and this has brought the more average punter who might have baulked at Ethereum NFTs burdensome minting and trading costs and disavowed the whole process before giving it a chance. Solana is quickly establishing itself as the second go-to blockchain for new NFT projects, and judging by the jam-packed launches of new collections — more than two a day — the momentum has only just begun.


# Designing Fair Access to NFTs

Atlas plans to launch a marketplace that brings fairness to the NFT space. Fairness is the greatest challenge facing this inchoate market. Atlas will build launchpads that exclude the impact of bots and not let one wallet mint hundreds of a collection. This ensures that there is an equitable distribution of chance to all those attending mint parties, as we believe that, by successfully creating this atmosphere, it will only add to the hype of these events and help propel the value of NFTs on the market.
We also hope to solve some of the enduring problems for new artists who want to mint NFTs, by offering an all in one sweatshop to mint and put NFTs up for sale directly. Finally, we want to leverage the inherent advantages of Solana to create a fast-paced, always updated, on-chain marketplace that truly captures the collectible trading frenzy that NFT collections can inspire, and give voice and heart to the wonderful art and the artists that create it — while seeing they are amply rewarded.
Our NFT launchpad system was designed to ensure a fair process from start to finish, whilst reducing load on the infrastructure.

# Tackling the problem

Thus, all auctions will be time-limited, with participation opening at a pre-announced date and time. Prior to the start of the event, users will be able to connect their wallets, complete a captcha, and obtain raffle tickets. Let’s assume that the launch price of each NFT is 1 SOL — then, you deposit 1 SOL for 1 raffle ticket. At a later stage, we will accept other tokens like $ATLS, or xToken for X project. Do mind that for the sake of fairness, wallets will have a limited and preset number of tickets defined for each project. As the launch timer runs out, an on-chain lottery will commence using the ‘verified random function’, by leveraging our integrated oracle. After the raffle, you can connect your wallet and claim the NFT won — if luck was not on your side this time around, you can simply claim back your deposit.
Our superior tech means we don’t need to charge gouging fees from creators to cover the costs, and Solana’s tiny transaction fees means buyers will pay almost exactly the price listed on the artwork. The Atlas DEX will capture the lightning of Solana NFTs and harness it to make a fair, fun and profitable playing field for all involved. It will take time, we will launch it in 2022, and change the Solana NFT marketplace when we do.
